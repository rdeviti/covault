# Benchmark Parameter Files

This folder contains JSON files that store parameters used for benchmarking various aspects of the system or software. These files are automatically generated by corresponding Python benchmark scripts, located in the same directory. These Python scripts are, in turn, executed by the Bash scripts found in the `run` directory. You can modify them manually if you know what you are doing, otherwise please edit the runfile only.

## Purpose

The JSON files in this directory serve as configuration inputs for our benchmarking framework. They allow for easy modification and experimentation with different benchmark settings without directly altering the Cpp scripts.

## Structure

Each JSON file in this folder typically corresponds to a specific benchmark or a set of related benchmarks. The naming convention for these files is usually descriptive, often mirroring the name of the Python script that generates them (e.g., `primitives_a1.json`, `ingress_a1.json`, etc.). The "a" refers to the party ("a" for generator, "b" for evaluator), and the "1" refers to the DualEx pipeline ("1" or "2"). 

The structure of the JSON files will vary depending on the specific benchmark they configure. However, they generally contain a top-level `"options"` key, which holds the specific parameters for the benchmark. Some files might also include a `"description"` key for informational purposes.

**Example JSON Structure (Primitives Benchmark):**

```json
{
    "description": "Primitives benchfile",
    "options": {
        "party": 1,
        "port": 50000,
        "peer_ip": "127.0.0.1",
        "outfile": "primitives_a1.csv",
        "n_reps": 1
    }
}
```

In this example:

- "description": Provides a brief description of the parameter file.
- "options": Contains the actual benchmark parameters as key-value pairs:
    - "party": An integer representing the party identifier.
    - "port": An integer specifying the network port.
    - "peer_ip": A string indicating the IP address of the peer (the other party).
    - "outfile": A string defining the name of the output CSV file.
    - "n_reps": An integer specifying the number of repetitions for the benchmark.
